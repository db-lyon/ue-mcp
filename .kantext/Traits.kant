⛩️:
  SpaceBond@Trait:
    meaning: A cross-cutting concern that applies to many UE concepts. Traits are orthogonal to the type hierarchy — any class, struct, or property might exhibit any combination of traits.
    purpose: The AI must reason about traits when modifying anything. A replicated variable has different rules than a local one. An editor-only component vanishes in shipping builds.

  Meaning@affects:
    meaning: What this trait influences
    Category: /Trait/Scope

  Meaning@discover_via:
    meaning: How to detect this trait on a given concept
    Category: /MCP/Discovery

Replication:
  meaning: Network replication — synchronizing state across server and clients in multiplayer.
  affects: Properties, Functions, Actors, Components
  discover_via: reflect_class (property flags), read_cpp_header (UPROPERTY specifiers), read_blueprint (variable flags)

  SpaceBond@ReplicatedProperty:
    meaning: Property value is synchronized from server to owning client (or all clients). Marked with Replicated or ReplicatedUsing specifier.
    constraint: Only works on properties of replicated Actors. Adding replication to a property requires the Actor to override GetLifetimeReplicatedProps.
    specifiers: Replicated, ReplicatedUsing=OnRep_FunctionName

  SpaceBond@RepNotify:
    meaning: A replicated property that triggers a callback when the value changes on the receiving end.
    pattern: Property has ReplicatedUsing=OnRep_X, and a UFUNCTION void OnRep_X() exists.

  SpaceBond@RPCs:
    meaning: Replicated function calls. Three kinds based on direction.
    SpaceBond@ServerRPC:
      meaning: Client calls, server executes. Marked Server.
      specifiers: Server, Reliable or Unreliable, WithValidation
    SpaceBond@ClientRPC:
      meaning: Server calls, owning client executes. Marked Client.
      specifiers: Client, Reliable or Unreliable
    SpaceBond@MulticastRPC:
      meaning: Server calls, all clients execute. Marked NetMulticast.
      specifiers: NetMulticast, Reliable or Unreliable

  SpaceBond@NetRelevancy:
    meaning: Whether an actor is relevant to a given client. Irrelevant actors don't replicate.
    constraint: Large open worlds use relevancy to limit bandwidth. Actors beyond NetCullDistanceSquared are culled.

Serialization:
  meaning: How UE saves and loads object state. Affects what survives between editor sessions, cooked builds, and save games.
  affects: Properties, Objects, Assets
  discover_via: reflect_class (property flags), read_cpp_header (UPROPERTY specifiers)

  SpaceBond@SaveGame:
    meaning: Property is included in save game serialization. Marked with SaveGame specifier.
    discover_via: Property flags contain SaveGame

  SpaceBond@Transient:
    meaning: Property is NOT serialized. Exists only at runtime. Lost when the object is saved or the session ends.
    specifiers: Transient, DuplicateTransient, NonPIEDuplicateTransient
    use_for: Cached values, runtime-only state, resolved references

  SpaceBond@Config:
    meaning: Property value is read from a config INI file. Marked with Config specifier.
    discover_via: read_cpp_header (Config specifier), search_config
    specifiers: Config, GlobalConfig

GarbageCollection:
  meaning: UE's automatic memory management for UObjects. The AI must understand GC to avoid dangling references and ensure proper lifetime management.
  affects: UObjects, Components, Actors

  SpaceBond@GCRoots:
    meaning: Objects that are GC roots won't be collected. Includes objects referenced by UPROPERTY on other rooted objects, actors in levels, and objects added to the root set.
    constraint: Raw C++ pointers (not UPROPERTY) are invisible to GC. Use UPROPERTY or TWeakObjectPtr.

  SpaceBond@PendingKill:
    meaning: Object is marked for destruction but not yet collected. IsValid() returns false. Weak pointers auto-null.

EditorVsRuntime:
  meaning: The distinction between what exists in the editor and what ships in the game. Critical for understanding what the AI can see vs what players experience.
  affects: Properties, Components, Modules, Plugins
  discover_via: read_cpp_header (WITH_EDITOR guards), reflect_class

  SpaceBond@EditorOnly:
    meaning: Exists only in editor builds. Stripped from cooked/shipping builds.
    markers: WITH_EDITOR, WITH_EDITORONLY_DATA preprocessor guards
    property_flag: EditorOnly on UPROPERTY
    constraint: Never reference editor-only types from runtime code. The build will fail.

  SpaceBond@DevelopmentOnly:
    meaning: Exists in development builds but stripped from shipping builds.
    markers: WITH_DEV_AUTOMATION, UE_BUILD_SHIPPING == 0

  SpaceBond@RuntimeOnly:
    meaning: State that only exists during gameplay. Not serialized, not in the editor.
    examples: Velocity, input state, animation pose, physics contacts

BlueprintExposure:
  meaning: How C++ functionality is exposed to Blueprint. Controls the visual scripting surface.
  affects: Properties, Functions, Classes

  SpaceBond@Meta:
